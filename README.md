# Facebook Chat Bot
## Overview
This Node.js project uses the [Unofficial Facebook Chat API](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api) and the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) to run a ChatGPT style bot from a Facebook account.   

Read the documentation on the Unoffical Facebook Chat API to learn how to customize bot functionality beyond the scope of this project.

-ChatGPT style bot that can be added to multiple groups with unique tracking

-DALLÂ·E 2 style image generation in Facebook chat

`BOT_NAME=[name]` - pick a name

`STAY_ON_FOR=5` - the number of messages a bot will reply to in a single wake cycle
