# Bot Commands

Here are the available commands for the bot:

| Command                 | Description                                               |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `-pic [prompt]`         | Creates and replies with an AI generated image. You can also use natural language prompts like "send me a picture of a tree" in a wake cycle. |
| `@[name]`               | Tagging the bot account will trigger a wake cycle.        |
| `-math [expression]`    | Calculates the result of the given math expression.       |
| `-cat [number]`         | Calculates how high a cat will go if N number of balloons were tied to it. |
| `leekspin [start/stop]` | Sends the leekspin gif. Unique timers for each sender in each thread. |

# .env Settings

Settings you can configure from within your .env file [(see example)](https://github.com/castey/facebook-chat-bot/blob/main/.env.example)

| Command                 | Description                                               |

| `FB_PASSWORD`           | Password for facebook account.      |
| `BOT_NAME`              | Choose a custom name for the AI to go by - optional but might improve performance slightly if you give it the same name as the account you're running the bot from. |
| `STAY_ON_FOR`           | Number of messages the AI will reply to during a wake cycle. |
| `COOLDOWN`              | Amount of time the AI waits between choosing to respond to messages during a wake cycle. |
| `HISTORY_LENGTH`        | Length of past messages to give the AI as context. |

## Side Notes

Using the image generation feature `-pic` saves the generated image to the AIpics subdirectory. 

Running `npm install` will show some vulnerabilities. This is because the dependencies used by the [Unofficial Facebook Chat API](https://github.com/Schmavery/facebook-chat-api) are outdated. This shouldn't be a problem as the project isn't serving to the public.
